FakeTeX is a theme for Typora inspired by LaTeX's default output and based on the [Academic Theme](https://github.com/typora/typora-theme-gallery/blob/gh-pages/media/theme/academic/academic.zip). The theme comes in two variants, Roman and Sans, and uses the [Latin Modern](https://github.com/slashfoo/lmweb) family of fonts.

## Demo

See the test PDFs for the [Roman](https://github.com/jack23247/typora-enterprise-theme/blob/master/test.pdf) and for the [Sans]() variants.

## Install

#### Automated install:

1. `chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh`

#### Manual install:

1. Open Typora and go to *File → Preferences → Appearance → Open Theme Folder*
2. Close Typora and copy `faketex.css`, `faketex-sans.css` and the `faketex` folder into the Typora Theme Folder
3. Open Typora and select *File → Preferences → Appearance → Theme → Faketex* or *Faketex Sans*

## Todo
